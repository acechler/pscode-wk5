// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


-- START --
a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers
-- END --

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

-- START --
value = input
if input % 2 == 0
    print value is even.
else 
    print value is odd.
-- END --


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

-- START --
MAX_READ_NUMBERS = 5
accumulator = 0
max = 0
min = 0
for i = 0; i < MAX_READ_NUMBERS; i++
    entry = input
    if entry < min 
        min = entry
    if entry > max
        max = entry
    accumulator += entry
    
average = accumulator/MAX_READ_NUMBERS
print("Min: " + min)
print("Max: " + max)
print("Average: " + average)
